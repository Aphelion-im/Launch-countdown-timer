## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- To combine a background image with a gradient. [How to combine a background image with a CSS 3 gradient](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2504071/how-do-i-combine-a-background-image-and-css3-gradient-on-the-same-element)
- I took some inspiration from this code in this article. [Create a digital clock HTML, CSS, JavaScript](https://www.makeuseof.com/create-a-digital-clock-html-css-javascript/)
- I noticed some text-align issues while using letters-spacing. [How to fix this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612058/letter-spacing-wrong-text-center-alignment)


### Continued development
- Alas, I couldn't implement the CSS flip clock, yet, as described in the bonus assignment: 
> **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle.
- I'll probably create a React and/or Vue version of this app.
